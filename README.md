# doodlebug

This repository aims to provide a playground for mathematical optimization.
It would be nice to see the convergence of parameters like an ant lion's den.

# How to use

```bash
pip install .
doodlebug
```

# Supported Model

- Line

    f(x) = ax + b

- Curve

    f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c

- Ellipse

    Since the parameters do not converge well, the definition of residuals may be incorrect.

- I'm looking for an interesting model.
